Problem 1 :  Reverse the File

Given a file, you need to reverse the contents of that file and store the results in a newly created file. The file and directory thus created, can only be read/written by the user who created it.
                                                             .........

* The Input for the program is via command line arguments.

    example : ./a.out filename

    where filename is the file to be reversed and stored in a new file.

* The new file is created is named as ReversedFile.txt
